	 *             handler.disconnect(new LiteralText("Only accept clients that can check!"));

	 *         ServerLoginNetworkHandler handler = context.getPacketListener();
	 *         PacketSender sender = context.getPacketSender();
	 *         MinecraftServer server = context.getEngine();
	 *         // Just send the CompletableFuture returned by the server's submit method
	 *         context.waitFor(server.submit(() -&gt; {
	 *             LoginInfoChecker checker = LoginInfoChecker.get(server);
	 *             if (!checker.check(handler.getConnectionInfo(), checkMessage)) {
	 *                 handler.disconnect(new LiteralText("Invalid credentials!"));
	 *                 return;
